# SASM - THE STUPID ASSEMBLER
# WHAT
SASM is a format for writing assembly code as well as an assembler for said code. Currently (and probably permanently) it does not have external linking so yeah gl w/ that. Gonna add it eventually but still working on the basics.
# WHY
the aim of this is to get practise with making assemblers so I can add it to my portfolio. Also bc why not pls kill me
# WHO
Me, Brandon, primarily; Nathaniel, who I saw doing it in class and just stole his idea (he does not contribute to this but I give him credit anyway just bc); David (@DavidAylaian), who refuses to take any part in state machines; Daniel, who can speak in machine code but can't understand his own words; and, of course, myself, again.
# HOW
Playing around with other assemblers, looking online at x86 ISA and stuff, reading too much hex to even deal with. 
# WHEN
May 2018-ish. Idk how far I'll go with this but if I do finish this project then having a memory of when I started would be nice but now your getting too specific.
# WHERE
None of your business. Stop asking questions now.


Get to coding.
